-------------------------------------------------------

[![Buy at MIT Press](/images/mp_logo.gif)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262533485) Murray, Janet. _[Hamlet on the Holodeck: The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/hamlet-holodeck-updated-edition)_. The MIT Press, 2017. ISBN: 9780262533485.  
_Hamlet on the Holodeck_ used to be 21W.765J's textbook. The book was written by [Janet Murray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Murray), who used to teach this class.

[Excerpts from _The Gutenberg Elegies_](http://archives.obs-us.com/obs/english/books/nn/bdbirk.htm)  
Sven Birkerts, who wrote _The Gutenberg Elegies_, was often depicted as Janet's nemesis by reporters who liked the word "nemesis".

[Vannevar Bush Biography](http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/elab/hfl0034.html)

[Starting Over](http://ted.hyperland.com/)

Apparently, another home page. Rather more useful links. Check out [Project Xanadu](http://xanadu.com/index.html) for meatier...uh, stuff.

[Ted Nelson and Xanadu](http://www.iath.virginia.edu/elab/hfl0155.html)  
A look at Ted Nelson, his terminology and what Xanadu is and isn't. A much shorter, older version is available from W3C.

[The Curse of Xanadu](http://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/)  
Of course, Wired gave their painfully technicolor $0.02 on Nelson.
